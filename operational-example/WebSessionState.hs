    Example:
    A CGI script that maintains session state
    http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~thiemann/WASH/draft.pdf

------------------------------------------------------------------------------}
{-# LANGUAGE GADTs, Rank2Types #-}
module WebSessionState where

import Control.Monad
import Control.Monad.Operational
import Control.Monad.Trans hiding (lift)

import Data.Char
import Data.Maybe

    -- external libraries needed
import Text.Html as H
import Network.CGI

    This example shows a "magic" implementation of a web session that
    looks like it needs to be executed in a running process,
    while in fact it's just a CGI script.
    
    The key part is a monad, called "Web" for lack of imagination,
    which supports a single operation
    
        ask :: String -> Web String
    
    which sends a simple minded HTML-Form to the web user
    and returns his answer.
    
    How does this work? The trick is that all previous answers
    are logged in a hidden field of the input form.
    The CGI script will simply replays this log when called.
    In other words, the user state is stored in the input form.
