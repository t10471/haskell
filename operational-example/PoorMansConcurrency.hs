    A concurrency monad runs several processes in parallel
    and supports two primitive operations

        fork  -- fork a new process
        stop  -- halt the current one
    
    We want this to be a monad transformer, so we also need a function  lift
    This time, however, we cannot use the monad transformer version  ProgramT
    because this will leave no room for interleaving different computations
    of the base monad.
